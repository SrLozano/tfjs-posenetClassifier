<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project 📘

This project is an AI-based sports application developed with the purpose of helping people to become better athletes. 

The underlying idea is that users doing sport in sports apps do not know whether they are doing the exercises right or wrong. Therefore, a computer vision architecture based on neural networks has been created so that, automatically, a user can know how well he or she is doing the exercises. 


Among the benefits of this application are:
* Improve the technique of athletes
* Avoid injuries
* And all this from the comfort of a web application:


### Built With 🛠

The application has been developed in Angular.

The AI architecture includes Tensorflow's PoseNet model. 🧠 https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet
